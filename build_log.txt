[        ]       Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
[        ]       allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
[        ]       targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
[        ]       minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
